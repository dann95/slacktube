 * You should never commit this file to a public repository on GitHub!

 * uploaded secrets.js file.
 *
 * I did it for your convenience using "throw away" API keys and passwords so
 * that all features could work out of the box.
 *
 * Another added benefit of this approach is that you can use two different
 * sets of keys for local development and production mode without making any
 * changes to the code.
